                        A sustainability culture means encouraging people to live, work, and make decisions in ways that protect the environment, support <br>
                        society, and ensure resources for future generations.<br>
                        A sustainability culture is a shared mindset and way of life where people make responsible choices to protect the environment, support <br>
                        society, and conserve resources for the future. It encourages habits like reducing waste, saving energy and water, and thinking about the <br>
                        long-term impact of everyday actions. When sustainability becomes part of culture, caring for the planet and future generations becomes a <br>
                        normal and collective responsibility.
